# Delegation — cryptographic MCP boundary (R262)

## Canonical approved-plan architecture

The approved signed DAG uses **task-local, in-process MCP**, not a
standalone Shared MCP HTTP service:

```text
Software Engineer (trusted host)
   → delegation-engineer.node → one Rust CryptoRuntime
   → preliminary/operational root DC issue/revoke (Engineer only)

Orchestrator → trusted signed Task DAG
   → owner-private, one-shot crypto MCP → authenticated native Rust Child DC
Backend / Frontend / Test (signed A2A Task)
   ├─ approved Gateway FunctionTools → Gateway → public Rust verifier → OPA
   │                                      → Gitea / exact-SHA Docker Runner
   └─ LocalCryptoMcpBridge (one-shot MCP SDK) → private task registry
        → role-authenticated native Rust socket (same CryptoRuntime)
        → signed VP used privately for Gateway Execute
```

The native Gateway verifier is **public-only** and independent of the
Engineer-owned signer. The model cannot call root issuance, alter delegated
permissions, read signing keys or access VP bytes. The MCP catalog offers
only `delegation_create_presentation`; repository/Runner tools belong to
the Gateway FunctionTools, with signed plan and OPA enforcement.

Production implementation: `poc/packages/agent-runtime/src/local-crypto-mcp-bridge.ts`,
`private-mcp-task-registry.ts`, `native-crypto-ipc.ts`,
`poc/mcp-shared/src/owner-private-child-mcp.ts`, and
`poc/packages/orchestrator-runtime/src/trusted-engineer-direct-core-port.ts`.
There is **no** `poc/mcp-shared/src/main.ts` executable or npm `start`
command. The obsolete remote `TrustedCryptoMcpBridge` SDK client has
also been physically removed.

## Retired remote compatibility paths

R264 physically removes the old `poc/mcp-shared/src/http-server.ts`,
`crypto-worker-router.ts`, and
`poc/packages/agent-runtime/src/private-mcp-worker-http.ts`,
plus their obsolete HTTP integration tests. The formerly remote
`TrustedCryptoMcpBridge` client was removed at R262.
Canonical A2A startup regressions continue checking that the private
crypto and repository HTTP worker routes are absent.

The historical Rust Adapter HTTP executable and separately selected
older credential transports still exist pending their own architecture
gate. They are **not** the canonical signed Engineer/Gateway path.
The underlying Rust `CryptoRuntime` crate must be preserved.

## Verification

Use the **free** task-local MCP and native Rust regressions, Fast CI,
and the Engineer-embedded signed Gitea/Docker DAG and D1 workflows.
The 4 November R258 positive DAG and R261 D1 both succeeded on their
respective SHAs; a new source change still needs its own green Fast CI
and a final consolidated same-SHA checkpoint. These scripted tests
do not certify autonomous Gemini repair.

No paid Gemini invocation, `main` merge, automatic PR merge or new
experiment is authorized by this cleanup.
